# Bash Commands

The main idea of this repo is to provide useful bash commands that i use on my daily. I will keep adding
more and more commands as everyday is an automation day

## How to install

Just execute `$ npm run setup` and you will have the commands available in your environment. Basically, it will add the commands path to your machine \$PATH so they can be available everywhere :tada:

Feel free to backup your \$PATH value if you don't want to keep commands anymore. Just restore and that's it.

## List of commands

1 - clean-git-branches: Clean all your workspace git branches except the current one and the master

2 - remove-orig: Remove all \*.orig files inside your current work directory

3 - install-aws: Install the cli of amazon
